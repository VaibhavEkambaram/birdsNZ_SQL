# New Zealand Birds
The New Zealand Birds app solves the problem that there is no easy-to-use and up to date app for finding information on all the birds found in New Zealand, which makes accessing reliable information unclear and more difficult. The intended outcome would allow not only hobbyists to augment their pastime but would also serve as a useful educational tool for others, particularly new users. The fields of tourism and conservation could also find this tool beneficial.  Additionally, the application should be able to be used in an offline environment; a necessity in an outdoors environment where birds would most likely be found. This app was created using the Corona SDK, which utilizes the Lua programming language
